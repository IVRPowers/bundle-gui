Program Error into its call/problem tracking system by opening a case, with a
unique case number, which describes the Program Error and has a severity level
(as described below) assigned to it. Each case is then electronically
dispatched and assigned to the appropriate resource. Once the necessary

Failure Definition:
A Low Severity issue is for non-production questions including general usage questions,
issues related to a non-production environment, or feature requests.
There is no impact on the quality, performance or functionality on
Licensee’s production system.

Response:
IVRPOWERS agrees that it will provide an initial response by a qualified member of its staff
o begin to diagnose a Low Severity fault within two (2) business day of notification by Licensee.

Response Target:
<24h

Severity 2:
Serious production impact; some loss of functionality

Failure Definition:
A Medium Severity issue has some business impact on a production system,
resulting in some functionality loss on Licensee’s production system.
The Software is usable, but does not provide a function in the most convenient
or expeditious manner.

Response:
IVRPOWERS agrees that it will provide an initial response by a qualified member of its staff
to begin to diagnose a Medium Severity fault within one (2) business day of notification
by Licensee via telephone. IVRPOWERS will use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve Medium Severity faults within thirty (30) days or in the next Update of the Software.
If IVRPOWERS determines, in its sole discretion, that the requirement is unique to
Licensee’s operations, IVRPOWERS will notify Licensee within two (2) weeks of receiving
notification of the fault with an appropriate recommendation and estimate for
resolving the incident.

Response Target:
<48h

Severity 3:
Degraded operation, malfunction of non-critical functions

Failure Definition:
A Critical Severity issue has significant to critical business impact on a production
system, resulting in Licensee’s production system being either down,
or functioning at a significantly reduced capacity.

Response:
IVRPOWERS agrees that it will provide a response by a qualified member of its staff
to begin to diagnose and to correct a High Severity fault within one (1) business day
after notification by Licensee via email and Telephone. IVRPOWERS will use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve High Severity faults as soon as possible.
The resolution will be delivered to Licensee as a work-around or as an emergency software fix.
If IVRPOWERS delivers an acceptable work-around instead of a solution,
the severity classification will drop to a Medium Severity or lower.

Response Target:
 <48h
